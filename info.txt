Hosting Used-netlify
MX Record: netlify
domain:anjalifireservices.com 
domain provider:godaddy

So this is how you add your email (MX) related records to Netlify:

/**********************************/
Point your domain’s name servers to Netlify
To use Netlify DNS, go to your domain registrar and change your domain’s name servers to the following custom hostnames assigned to your DNS zone.

dns1.p06.nsone.net
dns2.p06.nsone.net
dns3.p06.nsone.net
dns4.p06.nsone.net

/**************************************/

Configure MX Record:

Login to Netlify and head to the Domain Settings section for your site.
Scroll to the bottom of the page and look for the new DNS zones section. At the time of writing, it looked like this.
Netlify DNS
Select the zone relating to your domain.
Click the Add new record button and enter the settings.
Netlify DNS Record Dialog
The settings are as follows:

Type - MX.
Hostname - Will default to the name of your Netlify site name.
Value - This should be the server path for your email service. Do not include http:// or htpps://
TTL - This is the Time To Live setting for the record. The standard Netlify setting appears to be 3600 but I tend to set short TTL’s where possible.
Priority - This should be set to 10 from what I can ascertain.
Click the Save button and wait for between 15 and 30 minutes for the settings to propagate. Your email services should be working as before.

1. Go to your domain host's website in a new tab
If you're not sure who your domain host is, you can look up your domain host. Learn more

2. Sign in to your domain host
Sign in using your domain host's username and password. If you forgot your password, contact their support.

3. Go to your MX records to set up email
If you can’t find instructions for your domain host, use these general steps.

Note: If people already have email with your domain (such as user@yourdomain.com), create their user accounts in the Google Admin console before you set up your MX records. That way, they’ll continue to receive email.

In a second browser window or tab, sign in to your domain host account. Help me find my host.
Go to the section where you can update your domain’s MX records. It might be called something like DNS Management, Mail Settings, or Advanced Settings.
Select the option to add a new record.
4. Delete your old MX settings
Delete the current MX records that send mail to your old email provider. After that you'll add new MX records for Google Workspace.

If you can’t delete the existing records, change their priority number to 20 or higher.

5. Set up your email by adding MX records for Gmail.
From the Type drop-down list, select MX.
In the Name/Host/Alias field, enter @ or leave it blank.
In the Server/Mail Server/Value/Answer/Destination field, enter ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM..
In the Priority field, enter 1.
In the Time to Live (TTL) field, enter 3600 or leave the default value.
Click Save.
Follow these same steps to add the MX records shown in this table. Start from the top of the table and enter as many as you have room for.
MX SERVER ADDRESS	PRIORITY
ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.	5
ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.	5
ALT3.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.	10
ALT4.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.	10
Note: Each address is for a Google mail server. We provide several servers in case one becomes unavailable. Some hosts also require a trailing period at the end of the server name.
